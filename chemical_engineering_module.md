# Chemical Engineering Module

## 1. Stoichiometry
### Definition
Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.

### Example Calculation
For the reaction: 
\[ aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD \]
If we have 2 moles of A and 3 moles of B, and a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2:
- Moles of C produced = 2 moles A * (c/a)

## 2. Reactor Design
### Definition
Reactor design involves designing a vessel in which a chemical reaction occurs.

### Example Calculation
For a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), the volume can be calculated using:
\[ V = \frac{F_{in}}{C_{r}} \]
Where \( F_{in} \) is the inlet flow rate and \( C_{r} \) is the concentration of reactant.

## 3. Mass Balance
### Definition
Mass balance is the principle of conservation of mass applied to a system.

### Example Calculation
For a closed system: 
\[ \text{Input} - \text{Output} + \text{Generation} - \text{Consumption} = 0 \]

## 4. Heat Balance
### Definition
Heat balance involves accounting for the energy transfers in a system.

### Example Calculation
\[ Q_{in} - Q_{out} = \Delta H \]

## 5. Thermodynamics
### Definition
Thermodynamics studies the interrelations of heat, work, temperature, and energy.

### Example Calculation
Calculate the Gibbs free energy,
\[ \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S \]

## 6. Distillation
### Definition
Distillation is a method to separate components based on differences in volatility.

### Example Calculation
Using Raoult's law:
\[ P_{total} = P_{A}\ +\ P_{B} \]

## 7. Absorption
### Definition
Absorption involves the transfer of a substance from the gas phase to the liquid phase.

### Example Calculation
Mass transfer can be defined as:
\[ N = k_a 	imes (C_{gas} - C_{liquid}) \]

## 8. Adsorption
### Definition
Adsorption is the adhesion of molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface.

### Example Calculation
The amount adsorbed can be defined with:
\[ q = \frac{N}{m} \]

## 9. Fluid Mechanics
### Definition
Fluid mechanics is the study of fluids and the forces on them.

### Example Calculation
Bernoulli's equation:
\[ P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^{2} + \rho gh = constant \]

## 10. Pump Calculations
### Definition
Pump calculations involve determining the flow rate, pressure, and efficiency of pumps.

### Example Calculation
The pump power can be calculated as:
\[ P = \frac{Q \cdot \Delta P}{\eta} \]

## 11. Heat Exchanger Design
### Definition
Heat exchanger design involves creating a system to transfer heat between two or more fluids.

### Example Calculation
Using the log mean temperature difference (LMTD):
\[ Q = U A LMTD \]

## 12. Process Safety Calculations
### Definition
Process safety calculations identify risks and ensure safety in processes.

### Example Calculation
The risk assessment can be conducted using:
\[ Risk = Probability \times Impact \]
